WHAT THIS IS NOT: a text-to-video prompt with the story pasted into it. Everything on
screen comes from something the app already has, because a brand is a promise that the
thing on YouTube is the thing in the app:

    THE WORDS      app/data-stories.js — the eight scenes, verbatim, not re-written.
    THE VOICE      app/voice/st/pt-talkative-tortoise-*.mp3 — the same narration a child
                   hears in the reader. Nothing is re-synthesised for the video and Veo's
                   own audio track is DISCARDED, so the channel and the app share one voice.
    THE FACES      app/art/pt_tortoise.png and pt_heron.png, passed to the image model as
                   reference images on every single frame. Character drift across shots is
                   the failure mode of this whole technique, and reference art on every
                   call is the only thing that reliably holds it.
    THE WORLD      app/art/story/pt-talkative-tortoise.jpg — the story's own painting,
                   passed with the characters, which is where the ochre-and-gold Rajasthan
                   palette, the sunburst sky and the walled town on the horizon come from.

    docs/14-video-look-and-feel.md is the written half of this and is BINDING on any
    future episode. Read it before adding one.

THE AUDIO IS THE CLOCK. Veo returns exactly 8 seconds; narration segments are 2.7 to
13.9. So the assembly does not lay audio over a fixed cut — it gives every segment
ceil(d/8) clips and trims the video to the narration, which means a shot is never cut
away from a sentence and no sentence ever runs over silence.

ON THE ENDING. The Panchatantra's tortoise dies, and the app's telling is deliberately
elliptical about it -- "It was, in fact, the last one he ever had." The video is exactly
as elliptical: the mouth opens, the stick slips, and we cut to two geese circling an
empty sky. Nothing is softened and nothing is shown. That is an editorial decision, not
a technical one, and it is written down in the doc so the next episode inherits it.

Needs GEMKEY in the environment. Never write a key into a file.

# APPENDED TO EVERY FRAME PROMPT, WORD FOR WORD. The first cut of this film was
# rejected on three continuity failures, all of which are the same failure: a thing
# that is obvious to a person watching the whole film is invisible to a model drawing
# one frame. Reference images hold the DRAWING; they do not hold the RELATIONSHIP
# between two characters, and they do not hold what a character is doing with its
# mouth. Those have to be said, every time, in words.

#   SCALE      the tortoise came out shoulder-high to a bird in one shot and smaller
#              than its head in the next, then larger than both birds in a third.
#   THE BITE   the whole story turns on Kambugriva's mouth being FULL. The first cut
#              had him gripping the stick in his front paws, standing on it, and in
#              one shot roped to it in a little harness -- at which point opening his
#              mouth costs him nothing and the ending makes no sense.
#   THE BIRDS  one shot grew them blue crests and blue wing feathers. Different birds.
#
# None of these are style notes. Each one is load-bearing for the story.

  "or ring around the eyes.\n"
  "The two birds are identical to each other and identical to themselves in every shot.\n"
  "THE TOWN: a low pink-sandstone Rajasthani fort -- rounded domes, square towers, flat "
  "walls. Never a European fairytale castle, never pointed turrets.\n"
  "THE STICK, whenever it appears: a plain straight brown stick. Each bird holds one END "
  "of it crosswise in its beak. Kambugriva holds the MIDDLE OF THE STICK IN HIS MOUTH -- "
  "his jaws are closed on the wood, the stick passes between his lips, and all four of his "
  "legs hang loose and free in the air below him. He is NEVER tied, roped, strapped, "
  "harnessed or bandaged to the stick. He NEVER grips it with his feet or paws, never "
  "stands on it, never sits on it, and never rides on a bird's back. His mouth is FULL: "

    became a hold, the geese quietly re-rolled into different birds, and a tortoise falling

    nowhere to accumulate -- whatever happens in the middle, the shot ARRIVES where it was
    told to.

    The end frame is drawn from the shot's OWN start frame (passed as the last reference,
